I initialized the repo and did everything. Next week idk what we'll do


For the week of 10/26 I am going to start working on the security aspect. We've figured out what we're going to use
which is auth0. I've been reading up on it and this thursday at night Team Kenny Security is meeting up to work on it

Did a bunch of reading on auth0. 

Set up auth0 in a separate branch yesterday(10/29)

Today on 10/30 team security will hop on and put the finishing touches on auth0. Get a home page up and running, get login and registration done(10/30)
