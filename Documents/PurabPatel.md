# Progress Updates
## *10/22/22*
- Created War-Room thread
  - Meant as a distraction free chat for everyone in team kenny to discuss general design and consensus.
  - Announced plans of new team assignments based on preferences, didn't change teams around that much. Most important change was that I asked Raymond to do UI and he agreed.
  - Asked 4 different team specific questions so everyone could get started deciding how they would work on their part of the project.
  - Team UI - Discuss design for landing page, how will users be able to see calendar, todo list, profile, login/signup. You can use Figma to prototype a website layout.
  - Team API - Discuss design for database schema, what will be stored for user credentials, what information will be required for Appointments and Tasks?
  - Team Security - How will users Authenticate (In-House username/password auth? Google Identity services? Firebase? oAuth?) and access personal calendar and todo list.
  - Team DevOps/QA - Discuss schedules/strategies for testing current  build. Look into CI/CD for GitHub.

- Created TODO thread
  - Meant to provide the relevant teams with a concise description with what they need to get done for the week
  - Assigned everyone to provide Dhruv with their Github usernames
  - Assigned everyone to create their markdown files in the documents folder.
- Created Stand Ups thread
  - Meant to give the team, myself, and the professor updates on what everyone else is doing, so they can pace accordingly
- Created Resources thread
  - Meant to provide quick access to relevant information regarding the project, and current design plans.
-
## *10/23/22*

- Gave a quick update on StandUp thread to encourage others to use the StandUp thread as well

## *10/25/22*
- Created separate threads for each team to discuss team specific challenges and design choices.
- Set hard deadline for Team UI to create a basic outline for several pages on Figma and post on UI thread
- Set hard deadline for Team Security to decide on an authentication method
- Set hard deadline for Team API to come up with a database schema
- Set hard deadline for Team DevOps/QA to decide whether or not github CI/CD was worth implementing at this stage of the project.
